### Staging Area For New Documentation Set

See outline in [github issue 862 in the main repo](https://github.com/nimbella-corp/main/issues/862)

- but that outline is subject to revision as more writing appears here
- perhaps a limited, coarse-grained form of the outline should be inline in this README?

Eventually this file should be replaced by an overview document for the documentation set which will act as a guide to the whole.
When we get to that point

- this entire directory can move to the public repo and be renamed as `doc`
- documentation in this repo's `doc` directory that is subsumed by this documentation set can be removed
- the documentation build for our releases adjusted accordingly
